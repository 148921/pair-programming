# Exercise 3 - Code Review

In this exercise we'll look at the code we've already written and do a little code review!

## 1.1 What is Code Review?

:book: A code review is a process where two or more developers visually inspect a set of program code, typically, several times. The code can be a method, a class, or an entire program. The main code-review objectives are:

* Best Practice ~ A more efficient, less error-prone, or more elegant way to accomplish a given task.<br/>
* Error Detection ~ Discovering logical or transitional errors.

## 1.2 Important notes

:exclamation: Remember: Code can be very personal. The code is basically a thought process turned directly into text. Remember that your code is very personal to you when receiving critique so be nice when you review other peopleâ€™s code.
