# Exercise 3 - Code Review

In this exercise we'll look at the code we've already written and do a little code review!

## 3.1 What is Code Review?

:book: A code review is a process where two or more developers visually inspect a set of program code, typically, several times. The code can be a method, a class, or an entire program. The main code-review objectives are:

* Best Practice ~ A more efficient, less error-prone, or more elegant way to accomplish a given task.<br/>
* Error Detection ~ Discovering logical or transitional errors.

## 3.2 Code Review session

:book: In this exercise there is no actual coding. You should now have either one or two projects on your pc with the code written in exercise 1 and exercise 2. Go through the code and review both the functions and tests. What is good about the code and what could be done differently? Are there some "edge-case" tests that are missing? Reflecting on yours and others code is a good practice to being able to understand a problem and being able to explain a problem to others.

## 3.3 Important notes

:exclamation: Code can be very personal. The code is basically a thought process turned directly into text. Remember that your code is very personal to you when receiving critique so be nice when you review other peopleâ€™s code.

## 3.4

:star: If you finished all the work, go over to the bonus exercise. Here you will convert numbers to decimal numbers. Try to practice what you have learned so far about pair programming and TDD.
