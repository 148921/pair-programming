# Exercise 1 - Pomodoro-style :tomato: pairing

This exercise will focus on Pomodoro-style :tomato: pairing using the fizz buzz kata.

## 0.0 Dev environment setup

:exclamation: In this workshop we are going to use the Node.js to run JavaScript code from the command line.

### 0.1 Install Node.js/npm

:pencil2: After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), open up a command line window (Command Prompt or Powershell in Windows or Terminal in macOS) and type the following command:

```bash
$ node -v
v8.9.2
```

:pencil2: Verify that [npm](http://npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) was installed by typing the following command:

```bash
$ npm -v
5.6.0
```

## 1.1 Fizz buzz kata

:book: [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a word game designed teach children about division. Players take turns to count upwards from 1, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz".

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
- For numbers which aremultiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of five print "Buzz"
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

Example output:

```shell
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
... etc up to 100
```

## 1.2 Pair programming session

> :exclamation: **Session length:**  One pomodoro :tomato: - 25 minutes

:pencil2: Run through the Fizz buzz kata described above in pairs. Use Test Driven Development.

:pencil2: Use [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)-style :tomato: pairing: The _Driver_ (writes the code) and the _observer_ (helps, reviews and remembers things you need to do later on).

:pencil2: _Rotate every 5-6 minutes_ by swapping seats (the _driver_ becomes the _observer_, and vice versa). Use the same computer.
