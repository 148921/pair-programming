# Exercise 2 - Test/method-style pairing

This exercise will focus on Pomodoro-style pairing using the fizz buzz kata from the last exercise.

## 2.1 Pair programming session

> :exclamation: **Session length:**  30 minutes

:pencil2: Run through the Fizz buzz kata in pairs like the last exercise, but this time in _new pairs_.

:pencil2: Use test/method-paring: One person writes the test, the other writes the implementation code. Both should discuss.
